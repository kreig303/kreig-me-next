## Introduction

This is the Github repo for [kreig.me](http://kreig.me), and is intended to be a showcase of the skills I possess.

Inspired by the fact I have been _hella lazy_ about putting up a front-end project of my own so this one kills two birds with one stone, to whit:

1. FE Project in React
2. Blog for my writings

No matter which path my career takes from this point... I am covering my bases. :grin:
